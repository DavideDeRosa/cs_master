## Exam
The exam consisted of a group project in which we conducted a forensic analysis on a real-life case.

**Final grade: 30/30 with honors**

## Project
We were divided in three groups:
- Plaintiff
- Defendant
- Judge

My group was assigned the **Defendant** role, where we had to defend a company accused of delivering an incorrect quantity of products.  

Our tasks included acquiring the disk, analyzing its contents, and writing a detailed [report](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/blob/main/Digital_forensics/Progetto/Caso04/Convenuto/Caso04%20Convenuto.pdf) on our findings.  

Additionally, we prepared a [response](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/blob/main/Digital_forensics/Progetto/Caso04/Convenuto/Caso04%20Risposta%20a%20parte%20Attrice.pdf) to the *Plaintiff's* accusations, presenting arguments to support our defense.  

For our part, the group was composed by:
- [Myself](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa)
- [Marco Coppola](https://github.com/Murkrow02)
- [Valerio Pio De Nicola](https://github.com/xV4L3x)
