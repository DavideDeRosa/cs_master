## Exam
The exam structure is composed by different labs, delivered during the course, and a midterm. 

The final grade is composed by:
- Labs -> 50% of the final grade
- Midterm -> 50% of the final grade
- Attendance Bonus -> ±10%

**Final grade**: 

## Labs
Every lab, where possible, has been implemented with Python. 

A presentation has been made for every lab exercise.

- [**Lab1**](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Labs/1): location transparency
- [**Lab2**](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Labs/2): simple file reader with network transparency
- [**Lab3**](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Labs/3): producer/consumer with JSON data
- [**Lab4**](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Labs/4): simple gRPC server/client
- [**Lab5**](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Labs/5): simple Kafka usage
- [**Lab6**](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Labs/6): simple Linux Daemon for file logging 
- [**Lab7**](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Labs/7): simple DAPR implementation
- [**Lab8**](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Labs/8): weather mashup and web service
- [**Lab9**](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Labs/9): simple microservices system

## Midterm
I choose **Apache OpenWhisk** as my midterm topic.

Both the [paper](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Midterm/Paper) and the [presentation](https://github.com/DavideDeRosa/cs_master/tree/main/Distributed_Software_Systems/Midterm/Presentation) supporting it have been made with _Latex_.
