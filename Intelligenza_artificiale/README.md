## Exam
The exam structure is composed by a group project where you can freely choose a topic you would like to explore.

**Final grade: 30/30 with honors**

## Project
For our group project, we focused on **fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) using consumer hardware**, such as a MacBook Pro. 

After exploring various tools, we found that _IBM_'s **InstructLab** ([ILAB](https://instructlab.ai/)) provided the best approach, leveraging techniques like Synthetic Data Generation (SDG), LoRa, and QLoRa to make fine-tuning feasible on limited hardware.

Our objective was to adapt an existing model to generate [Jolie](https://www.jolie-lang.org/) code, a service-oriented programming language.

For a detailed breakdown of our results, check out our [final paper](https://github.com/Murkrow02/terron-IA/blob/main/relazione/latex/main.pdf).

The group was composed by:

- [Marco Coppola](https://github.com/Murkrow02)
- [Valerio Pio De Nicola](https://github.com/xV4L3x)
